                    Any and all payments made prior to the day of your reservation, including any deposits, are NON-REFUNDABLE, but may be transferred to anyone else at any point in time. However, any discounted prices paid will no longer cover the full price of the discounted services that were originally purchased after transferring the amount to the new person.

                    With your's and everyone else's safety and enjoyment as our top priorities, we may not permit you to skydive and deny you service for any reason deemed to be considered unsafe or threatening to yourself and/or anyone else here at Start Skydiving. This includes, but is not limited to, being under the influence of any intoxicating/impairing substances, including alcohol and drugs/narcotics (both, legal and illegal), unsafe weather conditions, unsafe body shape, size, height, and/or weight, unsafe health conditions, and unsafe aircraft/equipment issues. No refunds are given for anyone denied service due to any of these reasons. However, you may reschedule for another date or transfer any amount paid to another person.                    </label>

                    You must provide AT LEAST 24 HOURS NOTICE in order to cancel or reschedule for any reason. Canceling within less than 24 hours notice will result in a $25 surcharge.

A Tandem Master service fee of $1 per pound for every pound over 220 pounds while fully clothed will be charged after being weighed in upon arrival. Every single student is carefully evaluated by their instructors on an individual case-by-case basis prior to their jump and may denied service if deemed unsafe to skydive, even if the person's weight is under the limit. The only rare exception to this weight and height restriction is the special consideration of amputees.                    </label>
